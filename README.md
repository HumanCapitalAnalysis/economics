We outline the research program in the economics of human capital.

## Guest Lectures

We are very happy to welcome two guest lecturers who will provide brief presentations of their open source software projects.

### [respy](https://giphy.com/gifs/13HgwGsXF0aiGY/html5) by [janosg](https://github.com/janosg)

``respy`` is an open-source Python package for the simulation and estimation of a prototypical finite-horizon discrete choice dynamic programming model. Please visit their [online documentation](http://respy.readthedocs.io/) for details.


### [grmpy](https://giphy.com/gifs/13HgwGsXF0aiGY/html5) by [benediktkauf](https://github.com/benediktkauf)

``grmpy`` is an open-source Python package for the simulation and estimation of the generalized Roy model. It serves as a teaching tool to promote the conceptual framework of the generalized Roy model, illustrate a variety of issues in the econometrics of policy evaluation, and showcase basic software engineering practices. Please visit their [online documentation](http://grmpy.readthedocs.io/) for details.
