# Figures

We maintain a list of figures that are used throughout the organization. The
code for the figures is located in the subdirectory ``code``. All figures are
included in ``note`` document for easy review. When a new figure is added it
needs to be manually included in the review document. Simply calling
``./create`` will create all the figures, compile the notes, and provide a
``figures.pdf`` for further review.
