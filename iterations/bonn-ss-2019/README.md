#### Kickoff

* [Introduction to students](https://github.com/peisenha/intro_to_students/blob/master/dist/eisenhauer-introduction.pdf)

I briefly introduce my research background and provide a basic overview on my teaching efforts.

* [Course details](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/labor-economics/blob/master/iterations/bonn-ss-2019/00_course_outline.pdf)

We discuss some details about the course and in particular student projects.

* [Introduction to the NLSY79](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/nlsy_dataset/blob/master/distribution/presentation.pdf)

I present an overview on the NLSY79 dataset as we will encounter numerous empirical analysis based on the dataset throughout the course.

#### Syntopical reading

* [Reading scientific papers](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/talks/blob/master/research-skills/01-reading-scientific-papers/slides.pdf)

We discuss the research reported in Lagakos & al. (2018) in detail, trying to deduce some general lessons on how to read scientific papers in general.
