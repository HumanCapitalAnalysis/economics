## Lectures

The core lectures are available [here](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/labor-economics/blob/master/README.md).

### Guest lecture

We are lucky to draw on a set of guest lecturers for our different topics.

#### [segsell](https://github.com/segsell) on [grmpy](https://grmpy.readthedocs.io)

Sebastian Gsell will host a tutorial on the `grmpy` package to explore some selected issues in the static model of educational choice.

#### Kickoff

* [Introduction to the NLSY79](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/nlsy-data/blob/master/distribution/presentation.pdf)

I present an overview on the NLSY79 dataset as we will encounter numerous empirical analysis based on the it throughout the course.

#### Syntopical reading

* [Reading scientific papers](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/talks/blob/master/research-skills/01-reading-scientific-papers/slides.pdf)

We discuss the research reported in Lagakos & al. (2018) in detail, trying to deduce some general lessons on how to read scientific papers in general.
