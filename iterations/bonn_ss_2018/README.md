## Guest Lectures

I am very happy to welcome two guest lecturers who will provide brief presentations of their open source software projects.

#### 06/20/18 [janosg](https://github.com/janosg) on [respy](https://giphy.com/gifs/13HgwGsXF0aiGY/html5)

``respy`` is an open-source Python package for the simulation and estimation of a prototypical finite-horizon discrete choice dynamic programming model. Please visit the [online documentation](http://respy.readthedocs.io/) for details.


#### 06/13/18 [benediktkauf](https://github.com/benediktkauf) on [grmpy](https://giphy.com/gifs/13HgwGsXF0aiGY/html5)

``grmpy`` is an open-source Python package for the simulation and estimation of the generalized Roy model. It serves as a teaching tool to promote the conceptual framework of the generalized Roy model, illustrate a variety of issues in the econometrics of policy evaluation, and showcase basic software engineering practices. Please visit the [online documentation](http://grmpy.readthedocs.io/) for details.
