\begin{boenumerate}
\item Please consider the research articles by \citet{Lagakos.2018} and \citet{Carneiro.2011} we discussed in class.  Your task going forward is to explore the commonalities and differences between them concerning research questions, core findings, theoretical foundations, empirical challenges,and estimation strategies. \\

Both articles represent seminal work in their respective field.  However, we also discussed \citet{Lagakos.2018} as a shining example of clear, concise, and well structured academic writing.  Please adhere to the same principles when crafting your answers below.  Ample time is allocated to each question.  The quality of your writing is taken into account for grading purposes.

\begin{boenumerate}
\item  Please describe the research question and core findings using five sentences or less for each of the two articles.
\end{boenumerate}\vspace{0.3cm}

The Mincer equation \citep{Mincer.1974} is featured prominently in both articles.  However, each ofthem emphasizes different aspects of it.  \citet{Lagakos.2018} focus on the return to experience,while \citet{Carneiro.2011} concentrate on the return to schooling.

\begin{boenumerate}
\item Briefly  describe  the  two  economic  models  that  provide  the  theoretical  foundation  for  the Mincer equation.  What are their common features?  How do they differ?  Please keep the useof mathematical notation to a minimum.
\item Please provide and discuss some examples for different sources of heterogeneity in returns toexperience and schooling within and across countries?
\item How and to what degree does the estimation strategy in both papers account for them?

\item Please consider the research articles by \citet{Lagakos.2018} and \citet{Keane.1997} we discussed in class.  Your task is to explore the commonalities and differences between them concerning research questions,  core findings,  theoretical foundations, and estimation strategies. \\

Both articles represent seminal work in their respective field.  However,  we also discussed \citet{Lagakos.2018} as a shining example of clear, concise, and well structured academic writing.  Please adhere to the same principles when crafting your answers below.  Ample time is allocated to each question.  I take the quality of your writing into account for grading purposes.

\begin{boenumerate}
\item Please describe the research question and core findings using five sentences or less for each of the two articles.
\item Briefly describe the two economic models that we discussed at the beginning of the course that both lead to a positive relationship between human capital and labor market success but for very different reasons.  What are their common features?  How do they differ?  Please keep the use of mathematical notation to a minimum.
\end{boenumerate}

Both articles have very different strengths and weaknesses. \citet{Lagakos.2018} is a masterpiece in compiling, harmonizing, and analyzing a very diverse set of data sources to study cross-country differences in the return to experience and schooling. \citet{Keane.1997} pursue a theory-driven approach that links their analysis more closely to the core economics driving schooling investments.

\begin{boenumerate}
\item  Please provide and discuss examples that make schooling investments highly uncertain, sequential in nature, and exhibiting nonlinear returns.
\item How and to what degree does the estimation strategy in both papers account for these features?
